My name is Chen Shen, and I am a Postdoc in Materials Science and Engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. My research is interested in resolving outstanding fundamental scientific problems that impede the computational materials design process. An integrated paradigm combining the high throughput (HTP), machine learning (ML), Molecular dynamics (MD), and CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) methods was developed to design the functional materials, especially energy materials, including molten salts, optoelectronic materials, permanent magnets, magnetocaloric materials, superconductors, thermoelectric materials, thermal management materials, and lowâ€‘dimensional catalytic material. The paradigm focuses on studying the role of the lattice in various interactions, calculating and predicting the properties resulting from the corresponding couplings (shown in the figure above). In addition, in cooperation with experimental groups, research has also been carried out in phase diagram optimization, high-temperature and high-pressure ceramics, ferroelectrics, negative thermal expansion materials, and optical electronics.
